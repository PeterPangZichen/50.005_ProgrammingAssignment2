The problem we find:

The nounce fron the client: "Hello SecStore, please prove your identity!"
The nounce in Ks-(nounce) fron the client: "Hello this is SecStore!"
the nounce send by the client and the nounce in Ks-(nounce) is not the same as show in the graph. 
As a result of that, Authentication is offended because clients cannot verify the identity of the server.

How we deal with it:
the server use the same nounce sent by the cilent and use its own private key to encrypt the nounce.
